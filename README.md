# Chaos to Knowledge: Noise-Entropy Augmentation in Robotic Applications of Reinforcement Learning

This research examines the integration of entropy regularization and noise incorporation to advance reinforcement learning for high-dimensional tasks in robotic environments. By treating noise and entropy as interconnected elements of an informational framework, and combining them we develop a novel model that exhibits greater resilience to environmental disturbances and superior navigation of action possibilities. Evaluations in MuJoCo settings contrast baseline TRPO with shannon entropy term modulated by a coheficient hyperpameter, showing that entropy-infused approaches expand action diversity, boost disturbance tolerance, and match algorithmic strengths to task demands. Outcomes confirm that linking entropy with noise yields a stable equilibrium between discovery and reliability, with enhanced models thriving in intricate scenarios. These insights advance the creation of flexible reinforcement learning systems for practical robotic use.
